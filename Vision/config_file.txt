Camera number:0
Size of ArUco[m]:0.10

##############################################
Usually camera number is 0 but it can change if you have more than 1 camera connected on your computer.
Size of ArUco is the lenght of the square in meters.

Read me!
- First of all, you need to enter the camera number and the size of a side of the marker you are using

- Then, you need to calibrate the camera:
  Print the file "calibration_board.tiff" and open "camera_calibration.exe"
  Take multiple pictures with different angles of view (see exemples in folder calibration)
  Follow the instructions to calibrate the camera

- Finally, you need to reference the camera:
  You can open "video_tracking.exe" to have live information about the position and the orientation 
  relative to the camera

- To track the Aruco, you can manually open "photo_track.exe" or call it from an other application
  It will save the informations in the file "output.txt" and a picture "vision_aruco.png"
